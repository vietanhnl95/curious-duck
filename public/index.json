Propositions A proposition is a declarative sentence (that is, a sentence that declares a fact) that is either true or false, but not both. Examples: Toronto is the capital of Canada -\u003e This is a proposition (and it‚Äôs false) 1 + 1 = 2 -\u003e This is a proposition (and it‚Äôs true) What is the capital of the US? -\u003e This is not a proposition because it is not declarative x + 1 = 2 -\u003e This is not a proposition because it is either true or false The truth value of a proposition $p$: T when $p$ is true, and F when $p$ is false. An atomic proposition is a proposition that cannot be expressed in terms of simpler propositions.

I have been working in the Data Science field for a few years for some technology companies in Vietnam. This blog isn‚Äôt my r√©sum√©; therefore, if you want to know more about my experiences, please take a look at my maybe-up-to-date Linkedin profile Other than that, here are some hobbies of mine to be mentioned: Besides the nine-to-five work, in my free time, to cultivate my technical skills, I also do some coding, make analyses on random stuffs, and develop small data products. However, many of them are still in progress (due to my laziness), but you can still explore my Github for more information. Film photography is also one of my big passion. To know where most of my money goes, you can check out my Instagram. A friendly advice, shooting film will make you broke, so don‚Äôt try it. However, it‚Äôs free to hit like on my photos. Try that one instead üòé I love coffee, from drinking, brewing to wandering around different coffee shops. I hope that I can open my own coffee shop(s) someday. Of course, I also like learning and sharing. That‚Äôs why I started this blog, and I will dedicate the whole next section to elaborate this.

Everyday, new technologies are introduced, best practices are kept being challenged and replaced by the new ones. The only way to adapt is to apply a beginner‚Äôs mindset - curious, open to new ideas, eager to learn, and not based on preconceived notions or prior knowledge. Learning is important, but it‚Äôs even more important to learn effectively. Time is limited while there are always too many things to learn, and I believe that writing and sharing is highly helpful in acquiring new knowledge. In this blog, I will write about various topics, ranging from data science, maths to coffee brewing, book reviews or even literature. Technically, it can be any knowledge that I find interesting that I want to save and share. To keep everything well-organized, there will be categories and tags for each post. You might wonder that why I named this blog ‚ÄúCurious Duck‚Äù. Firstly, curiosity is a required quality for exploration and learning. Without being curious, we won‚Äôt question; therefore, no answer is found. Secondly, a goal in learning and also a trait that I aim for, is to become as versatile as possible. Duck is also a versatile animal that can walk, swim and fly - the three basic movement methods. The other reason is Duck is also a nickname that many friends of mine call me, so it came first to my mind when giving this blog a name. I hope that you will enjoy my blog and always remember that: Learning is a lifelong journey.
