Examples: Toronto is the capital of Canada -\u003e This is a proposition (and it‚Äôs false) 1 + 1 = 2 -\u003e This is a proposition (and it‚Äôs true) What is the capital of the US? -\u003e This is not a proposition because it is not declarative x + 1 = 2 -\u003e This is not a proposition because it is either true or false The truth value of a proposition $p$: T when $p$ is true, and F when $p$ is false. An atomic proposition is a proposition that cannot be expressed in terms of simpler propositions.

This blog isn‚Äôt my r√©sum√©; therefore, if you want to know more about my experiences, please take a look at my maybe-up-to-date Linkedin profile Other than that, here are some hobbies of mine to be mentioned: Besides the nine-to-five work, in my free time, to cultivate my technical skills, I also do some coding, make analyses on random stuffs, and build small data products. However, many of them are still in progress (due to my laziness), but you can still explore my Github for more information. Film photography is also one of my big passion. To know where most of my money goes, you can check out my Instagram. A friendly advice, shooting film will make you broke, so don‚Äôt try it. However, it‚Äôs free to hit like on my photos. Try that one instead üòé I love coffee, from drinking, brewing to wandering around different coffee shops. I hope that I can open my own coffee shop(s) someday.

What does it mean to ‚Äúknow?‚Äù Richard Feynman believed that ‚Äúthe world is much more interesting than any one discipline.‚Äù He understood the difference between knowing something and knowing the name of something, as well as how, when you truly know something, you can use that knowledge broadly. When you only know what something is called, you have no real sense of what it is. You can‚Äôt take it apart and play with it or use it to make new connections and generate new insights. When you know something, the labels are unimportant, because it‚Äôs not necessary to keep it in the box it came in. ‚ÄúThe person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.‚Äù ‚ÄîMortimer Adler ","date":"2021-09-05","objectID":"/about/:3:0","tags":null,"title":"Hello World","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":["Linear Algebra"],"content":"Linear combination: With a set of vectors {$\\vec{v_1}$, $\\vec{v_2}$, ‚Ä¶, $\\vec{v_n}$} in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the linear combination of those vectors is: $$ c_{1}\\vec{v_1} + c_{2}\\vec{v_2} + ‚Ä¶ + c_{n}\\vec{v_n} $$ Examples In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we have 2 vectors: $\\vec{v} = (1,2)$ and $\\vec{w} = (4,-1)$: $2\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$ + 3$\\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}$ $\\begin{bmatrix} a \u0026 b \\ c \u0026 d \\end{bmatrix}$ $2(1,2) + 3(4,-1)$ is a linear combination of $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{w}$ $5(1,2) - 1(4,-1)$ is also a linear combination of $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{w}$ ","date":"2021-09-03","objectID":"/posts/vectors/:0:1","tags":["math"],"title":"Math Test","uri":"/posts/vectors/"},{"categories":["Linear Algebra"],"content":"Vector operations With $\\vec{v}=(v_1, v_2)$ and $\\vec{w}=(w_1, w_2)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ Addition: $$\\vec{v} + \\vec{w} = (v_1 + w_1, v_2 + w_2)$$ Scalar Multiplication: $$c\\vec{v} = (cv_1, cv_2)$$ Length of a vector: $$||\\vec{v}|| = \\sqrt{\\vec{v}.\\vec{v}} = \\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}$$ A unit vector is vector whose length equal 1: $||\\vec{u}|| = 1$ $\\vec{u} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{||\\vec{v}||}$ (a unit vector is equal to a vector divided by its length) Dot product: $$\\vec{v}.\\vec{w} = v_1w_1 + v_2w_2$$ The dot product reveals the angle between 2 vectors: $$cos\\theta = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{||\\vec{v}||}.\\frac{\\vec{w}}{||\\vec{w}||} = \\vec{u_v}.\\vec{u_w}$$ with $\\vec{u_v}$ and $\\vec{u_w}$ are the 2 unit vectors of $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{w}$ ","date":"2021-09-03","objectID":"/posts/vectors/:0:2","tags":["math"],"title":"Math Test","uri":"/posts/vectors/"}]
