In his paper, Euler has introduced an elegant way to solve the Seven Bridges of Königsberg - one the most well-known problem in mathematics. The problem set theme in the city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). The Pregel River divided the city into 2 mainlands and 2 large islands, whom are connected by seven bridges. The Seven Bridges of Königsberg\" The Seven Bridges of Königsberg The question is simple: Can you draw a path to walk through the city (i.e cross all the seven bridges) without crossing each bridge more than once? If you haven’t known this problem or its solution, I suggest you not to look at the below answer right away. Instead, let spend five minutes to try to solve it on your own first, then look at the answer. I will put a picture of a duck here as a break. Confusing duck\" Confusing duck Euler’s Solution Now, let’s see how Euler used graph theory to solve the problem. Graph representation of the problem\" Graph representation of the problem Euler reformulated the problem into vertices and edges: Each vertex (point) represents a piece of land Each edge (line) represents a bridge. So we will have a graph representation of the original problem in figure b with 4 vertices, connected to each other by a total of 7 edges. To be able to cross all the briges without crossing each more than once, the number of edges connected to a vertex need to be an even number (except for the ones chosen for start and finish), because once we enter a piece of land, we need another bridge to walk away from it. In this problem, we can see that all 4 vertices are touched by an an odd number of edges (3 or 5). Since we can only have one starting point and one finishing point, there can be only 2 vertices that have an odd number of adjacent edges. This leads to a contradiction; hence, it is impossible to solve the problem.

How many steps does it take to have a result in the right figure If you are interested in solving this, I will not spoil the answer immediately. Instead, you will have another 5 minutes to try solving it on your own. Here come the duck again Confusing duck, again\" Confusing duck, again Solution As we have seen in the first problem, to model the problem using graph theory, we will transform it into vertices and edges: Each vertex represents a square. We will label them from 1 to 9 as in the following matrix: $\\begin{bmatrix} 1B \u0026 2 \u0026 3B \\\\\\ 4 \u0026 5 \u0026 6 \\\\\\ 7W \u0026 8 \u0026 9W \\end{bmatrix}$ Each edge represents the possibility to move from one square to another. For you who don’t know how to play chess, a knight has an L-shaped move. For example, the knight at square 1 can move to either square 6 or 8. Graph representation of the Puzzle (source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org)\" Graph representation of the Puzzle (source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org) The above graph illustrates the initial and desired state of the game. As we can see, to solve this problem, we need to be able to reorder the knights from Black-Black-White-White to Black-White-Black-White. This is impossible because the order will always remain the same no matter what moves we make except when a knight can leap over another.

By definition, Graphs are discrete structures consisting of vertices and edges that connect these vertices. Problems in almost every conceivable discipline can be solved using graph model. In the above puzzles, you can make many trials trying to solve the games. After a while, you might feel that the problem is unsolvable, but you don’t have a solid method to actually prove it. That’s when Graph Theory comes into play. Graphs can be used to model many types of relations and processes in a variety of areas, from physics, biology to information systems, and has a wide range of applications such as: Representing the competition of different species in an ecological niche Finding communities in networks, such as social media Web page ranking Finding the shortest path between two points in a transportation network (Route Optimization) etc ","date":"2021-09-18","objectID":"/posts/grapth-theory-basic/:1:3","tags":["graph-theory"],"title":"An Introduction to Graph Theory","uri":"/posts/grapth-theory-basic/"},{"categories":["Discrete Math"],"content":"Fundamental Concepts of Graph Theory Now let’s go through some basic concepts in Graph Theory ","date":"2021-09-18","objectID":"/posts/grapth-theory-basic/:2:0","tags":["graph-theory"],"title":"An Introduction to Graph Theory","uri":"/posts/grapth-theory-basic/"},{"categories":["Discrete Math"],"content":"Graph A graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of $V$, a nonempty set of vertices (or nodes) and $E$, a set of edges.

Try that one instead 😎 I love coffee, from drinking, brewing to wandering around different coffee shops. I hope that I can open my own coffee shop(s) someday.

Everyday, new technologies are introduced, best practices are kept being challenged and replaced by the new ones.

Learning is important, but it’s even more important to learn effectively. Time is limited while there are always too many things to learn, and I believe that writing and sharing is highly helpful in acquiring new knowledge. In this blog, I will write about various topics, ranging from data science, maths to coffee brewing, book reviews or even literature. Technically, it can be anything that I find interesting, and I want to and share with others. To keep everything well-organized, each post will be labeled with categories and tags.

Without being curious, we won’t question; therefore, no answer is ever found. Secondly, a goal in learning, and also a trait that I aim for, is to become as versatile as possible. It’s better to see the world through a multidisciplinary view. Duck is also a versatile animal that can walk, swim and fly - the three basic movement methods.
