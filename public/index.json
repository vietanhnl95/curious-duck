[{"categories":["Discrete Math"],"content":"1. Propositions A proposition is a declarative sentence (that is, a sentence that declares a fact) that is either true or false, but not both. Examples: Toronto is the capital of Canada -\u003e This is a proposition (and it’s false) 1 + 1 = 2 -\u003e This is a proposition (and it’s true) What is the capital of the US? -\u003e This is not a proposition because it is not declarative x + 1 = 2 -\u003e This is not a proposition because it is either true or false The truth value of a proposition $p$: T when $p$ is true, and F when $p$ is false. An atomic proposition is a proposition that cannot be expressed in terms of simpler propositions. Example: “David Beckham is an English footballer” is a proposition, but it’s not atomic, since it can be broken down into two simpler atomic propositions: “David Beckham is English” and “David Beckham is a footballer” Let $p$ be a proposition, the negation of $p$, denoted by $\\neg{p}$ or $\\overline{p}$ is the statement “It is not the case that $p$\" Example: The negation of “I have a Macbook” is “It’s not the case that I have a Macbook” or in simpler language “I do not have a Macbook” The truth table of $\\neg{p}$: $p$ $\\neg{p}$ T F F T Let $p$ and $q$ be propositions The conjunction of $p$ and $q$, denoted by $p \\land q$, is the proposition “$p$ and $q$” The disjunction (inclusive or) of $p$ and $q$, denoted by $p \\lor q$, is the proposition “$p$ or $q$”. It is true when at least one of $p$ and $q$ is true. The exlcusive or of $p$ and $q$, denoted by $p \\oplus q$, is the proposition that is true when exactly one of $p$ and $q$ is true. The conditional statement $p \\rightarrow q$ is the proposition “if $p$, then $q$.\". The converse of $p \\rightarrow q$ is $q \\rightarrow p$ The inverse of $p \\rightarrow q$ is $\\neg{p} \\rightarrow \\neg{q}$ The contrapositive of $p \\rightarrow q$ is $\\neg{q} \\rightarrow \\neg{p}$ The biconditional statement $p \\leftrightarrow q$ is the proposition “$p$ if and only if $q$” The truth table: $p$ $q$ $p \\land q$ $p \\lor q$ $p \\oplus q$ $p \\rightarrow q$ $q \\rightarrow p$ $\\neg{p} \\rightarrow \\neg{q}$ $\\neg{q} \\rightarrow \\neg{p}$ $p \\leftrightarrow q$ T T T T F T T T T T T F F T T F T T F F F T F T T T F F T F F F F F F T T T T T Comments: - The conditional statement $p \\rightarrow q$ and it’s contrapositive $\\neg{q} \\rightarrow \\neg{p}$ is equivalent because they always have the same truth values - The converse $q \\rightarrow p$ and inverse $\\neg{p} \\rightarrow \\neg{q}$ of a conditional statement $p \\rightarrow q$ is also equivalent ","date":"2021-09-05","objectID":"/posts/logic-and-proofs/:1:0","tags":["math"],"title":"Discrete Mathematics: Logic and Proofs","uri":"/posts/logic-and-proofs/"},{"categories":["Discrete Math"],"content":"2.
