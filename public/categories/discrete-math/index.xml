            </div>What is Graph Theory? The Seven Bridges of Königsberg Problem Description This history of graph theory is considered to be started from 1973 with a paper by Leonhard Euler. In his paper, Euler has introduced an elegant way to solve the Seven Bridges of Königsberg - one the most well-known problem in mathematics.
The problem set theme in the city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). The Pregel River divided the city into 2 mainlands and 2 large islands, whom are connected by seven bridges.]]></description>
