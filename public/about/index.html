<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Viet Anh. I have been working in the Data Science field for a few years for some technology companies in Vietnam. This blog isn&rsquo;t my résumé; therefore, if you want to know more about my experiences, please take a look at my maybe-up-to-date <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viet-anh-nguyen-16116710a/">Linkedin profile</a>
<br/><br/>
Other than that, here are some hobbies of mine to be mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Besides the nine-to-five work, in my free time, to cultivate my technical skills, I also do some coding, make analyses on random stuffs, and develop small data products. However, many of them are still in progress (due to my laziness), but you can still explore my <a href="https://github.com/vietanhnl95">Github</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Film photography is also one of my big passion. To know where most of my money goes, you can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/s.i.eu/">Instagram</a>. A friendly advice, shooting film will make you broke, so don&rsquo;t try it. However, it&rsquo;s free to hit like on my photos. Try that one instead 😎</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love coffee, from drinking, brewing to wandering around different coffee shops. I hope that I can open my own coffee shop(s) someday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, I also like learning and sharing. That&rsquo;s why I started this blog, and I will dedicate the whole next section to elaborate this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-this-blog">About this blog</h2>
<p>I am working in a field that is broad and rapidly changing. Everyday, new technologies are introduced, best practices are kept being challenged and replaced by the new ones. The only way to adapt is to apply a beginner&rsquo;s mindset - curious, open to new ideas, eager to learn, and not based on preconceived notions or prior knowledge.
 </p>
<p>Learning is important, but it&rsquo;s even more important to learn effectively. Time is limited while there are always too many things to learn, and I believe that writing and sharing is highly helpful in acquiring new knowledge.
 </p>
<p>In this blog, I will write about various topics, ranging from data science, maths to coffee brewing, book reviews or even literature. Technically, it can be any knowledge that I find interesting that I want to save and share. To keep everything well-organized, there will be <em>categories</em> and <em>tags</em> for each post.
 </p>
<p>You might wonder that why I named this blog <strong>&ldquo;Curious Duck&rdquo;</strong>. Firstly, curiosity is a required quality for exploration and learning. Without being curious, we won&rsquo;t question; therefore, no answer is found. Secondly, a goal in learning and also a trait that I aim for, is to become as versatile as possible. Duck is also a versatile animal that can walk, swim and fly - the three basic movement methods. The other reason is Duck is also a nickname that many friends of mine call me, so it came first to my mind when giving this blog a name.</p>

<p>I hope that you will enjoy my blog and always remember that: <strong>Learning is a lifelong journey</strong>.</p>
<!-- Mortimer Adler, a famous American philosopher once said in his famous book _How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading_ that “The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks." -->
<!-- You might wonder that this blog is named "Curious Duck"?

Firstly, duck is a versatile animal because it can walk, swim, and fly


What is curious: **"A desire to know or learn"**

Why:

- We always want to be wise, but being wise does not mean you have to have all the answers. Instead, we know how to look for the answer and will look for the answers
- The world is changing more rapidly than ever. So besides acquiring knowledge, we also need to update it frequently

being willing and able to question your knowledge and the knowledge of others is how you keep improving. Learning is a journey.

beginner’s mind – curious, open to new ideas, eager to learn, and not based on preconceived notions or prior knowledge.


Albert Einstein’s famous words, “I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.” We might well quibble with the notion that Einstein had no “special talent,” but he wouldn’t have solved the riddles of the universe if not for his passionate curiosity. Then I came across another Einstein quote: “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.

the only constant is change


## Why I write and share?



What does it mean to “know?”
Richard Feynman believed that “the world is much more interesting than any one discipline.” He understood the difference between knowing something and knowing the name of something, as well as how, when you truly know something, you can use that knowledge broadly. When you only know what something is called, you have no real sense of what it is. You can’t take it apart and play with it or use it to make new connections and generate new insights. When you know something, the labels are unimportant, because it’s not necessary to keep it in the box it came in.
