## About me

Hi, my name is Viet Anh. I have been working in the Data Science field for a few years for some technology companies in Vietnam. This blog isn't my résumé; therefore, if you want to know more about my experiences, please take a look at my maybe-up-to-date <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viet-anh-nguyen-16116710a/">Linkedin profile</a>
<br/><br/>
Other than that, here are some hobbies of mine to be mentioned:

- Besides the nine-to-five work, in my free time, to cultivate my technical skills, I also do some coding, make analyses on random stuffs, and build small data products. However, many of them are still in progress (due to my laziness), but you can still explore my <a href="https://github.com/vietanhnl95">Github</a> for more information.  

- Film photography is also one of my big passion. To know where most of my money goes, you can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/s.i.eu/">Instagram</a>. A friendly advice, shooting film will make you broke, so don't try it. However, it's free to hit like on my photos. Try that one instead :sunglasses:

- I love coffee, from drinking, brewing to wandering around different coffee shops. I hope that I can open my own coffee shop(s) someday.

- Of course, I also like learning and sharing. That's why I started this blog, and I will dedicate the whole next section to elaborate this.

## About this blog

You might wonder: "Why Curious Duck?"

Curious is one 

- By definition, curiosity can be expressed as **"A desire to know or learn"**
- Why we need to be curious:
    - We always want to be wise, but being wise does not mean you have to have all the answers.
    - The world is changing more rapidly than ever. So besides acquiring knowledge, we also need to update it frequently


Another way to get smarter, outside of reading, is to surround yourself with people who are not afraid to challenge your ideas.


beginner’s mind – curious, open to new ideas, eager to learn, and not based on preconceived notions or prior knowledge.

being willing and able to question your knowledge and the knowledge of others is how you keep improving. Learning is a journey.

Albert Einstein’s famous words, “I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.” We might well quibble with the notion that Einstein had no “special talent,” but he wouldn’t have solved the riddles of the universe if not for his passionate curiosity. Then I came across another Einstein quote: “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.

the only constant is change


## Why I write and share?



What does it mean to “know?”
Richard Feynman believed that “the world is much more interesting than any one discipline.” He understood the difference between knowing something and knowing the name of something, as well as how, when you truly know something, you can use that knowledge broadly. When you only know what something is called, you have no real sense of what it is. You can’t take it apart and play with it or use it to make new connections and generate new insights. When you know something, the labels are unimportant, because it’s not necessary to keep it in the box it came in.

“The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.” —Mortimer Adler
