## Impartial games

In Combinatorial Game Theory, a major distinction is drawn between impartial games and partisan games. To be impartial, a game must satisfy these conditions:

1. The game is finite; i.e. there is a constant 𝑐 such that all games end in 𝑐 moves or fewer.

2. There are no draws; either player 1 or player 2 wins.

3. The rules of the game draw no distinction between the players. That is, given any position, if we switch the active player then the set of legal moves is still the same, and the player who wins the game under perfect play switches.
