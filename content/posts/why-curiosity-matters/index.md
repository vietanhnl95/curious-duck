## What is curiosity?

By definition, curiosity can be briefly expressed as **"A desire to know or learn"**. When you are curious about a subject, it means that you want to know more about it. To make it very clear before going into further analysis, when I mention the term _curious_, what actually I imply is the curiosity for useful knowledge. It's when you ask questions like: _"How do I do this task more effectively?"_, _"Why do I need to study maths?"_, .. not the type of curiosity about others' personal stuffs, such as _"Why haven't you married yet?"_ or _"What do you do?"_. The later is either good or bad, depending on the questioners' intention, but the former is always good.
